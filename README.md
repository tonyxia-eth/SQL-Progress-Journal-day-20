# Day 20 â€“ Subquery Breakthrough ðŸŽ¯

## âœ… What I Practiced
- Scalar subqueries using `MAX()` and `AVG()`
- Comparing values in `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses
- Writing clean, readable SQL without shorthand
- Logical breakdown of inner (subquery) and outer queries
- Real-world filtering with nested data references

## ðŸ§  Key SQL Concept
Subqueries can return a single value and be used in conditions like:

```sql
SELECT players.first_name, players.last_name, salaries.salary
FROM players
JOIN salaries ON players.id = salaries.player_id
WHERE salaries.year = 2001
  AND salaries.salary < (
      SELECT MAX(salary)
      FROM salaries
      WHERE salaries.year = 2001
  )
ORDER BY salaries.salary DESC
LIMIT 10;


ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
Subqueries donâ€™t have to be scary when broken down logically.

I now understand the difference between inner and outer queries.

This lesson built directly on top of JOIN + GROUP BY logic from earlier days.

ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s Next
Master subqueries inside HAVING clauses
